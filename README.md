# Sentimov

## What is this?
-  This is my senior project website. It is a sentiment analysis of movie tweet on Twitter using various kinds of algorithms.
It's written in Python (Django) and AngularJS. This website will classify tweets into three categories: positive, negative and neutral.

## How to run the website?
- Go to the website
```sh
https://ide.c9.io/zephyrmathias/senior

- then type on the command line at the bottom of the screen
```sh
python manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT
```
- the website will be running on http://senior-zephyrmathias.c9users.io:8080/

## How to use the website?
- type a movie name you want to see review results
- it will show up all the search results related to your movie name
- find the movie and click GET button at the bottom-right corner
- wait for the Twitter API getting tweets (you can stop getting tweets if you want to)
